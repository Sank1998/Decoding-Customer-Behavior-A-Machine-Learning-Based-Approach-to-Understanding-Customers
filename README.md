# Decoding-Customer-Behavior-A-Machine-Learning-Based-Approach-to-Understanding-Customers
This project analyses customer importance and marketing strategies, incorporating advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze decision-making. It then explores the business benefits of understanding customers.

In the modern world, customer behavior towards the brand is one of the most crucial factors
in determining the success of a business. To understand customer behavior, businesses have 
used various tools and techniques. Machine Learning algorithms are one such tool that can 
be used to analyze customer data and make informed decisions. The use of Machine Learning 
algorithms has become increasingly popular due to their ability to process substantial 
amounts of data quickly and accurately. In addition to Machine Learning algorithms, RFM 
analysis and CLTV are also important tools for understanding customer behavior and knowing 
their value. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. It is used to analyze 
customer behavior and identify potential opportunities for upselling. CLTV stands for 
Customer Lifetime Value and is used to calculate the value of a customer over their lifetime.

The goal is to understand the impact of Machine Learning algorithms and other models in 
understanding customer behavior. The study is conducted on online retail gift shops customer 
data sourced from machine learning repository, which includes data from a customer 
management system. The data includes eight attributes which are Invoice, Stock Code, 
Description, Quantity, Invoice Date, Unit Price, Customer ID, Country. An extensive literature 
survey is conducted to research the different methods or machine learning algorithms used 
to understand customers behavior. After going through a plethora of research papers and 
academic compilations of the scholars in this field, a few particularly important methodologies 
are used in this study. 

Initially the data is processed through python and cleaned to get rid of the missing values, null 
values, duplicates, outliers, and date time irregularities. Later exploratory descriptive analysis 
(EDA) is performed to understand the data. Graphs are plotted to understand the variables
and the relationship between them. 

After getting well versed with the dataset, customer segmentation is carried out on the bases 
of RFM metrics. The customers are segmented on the bases of RFM (recency of purchase, 
frequency of purchase, and Monetary value they bring to the table). A K-Means Clustering 
algorithm is also performed to segment customers and later the customers lifetime value is 
also predicted.

The research findings suggest that K-means clustering is an effective tool for clustering data 
points. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning technique used to group data 
points into distinct clusters or groups. However, when combined with RFM metrics, it is even 
more effective. The research found that RFM metrics can help to identify customer segments 
and target them more effectively, leading to increased customer loyalty and better marketing 
performance. Furthermore, the research found that K-means clustering is able to accurately 
identify customer segments and group them according to their preferences and buying 
behaviors. 

Buying behavior is the process of studying and analyzing how consumers make their buying 
decisions. It is important to understand buying behavior because it can help businesses better 
understand their target customers and develop strategies to reach them. Knowing who your 
target customers are and what motivates them to make a purchase can help you create 
tailored marketing messages that will resonate with them. This is significant for companies in 
customer segmentation because it allows them to tailor their products and services to the 
specific needs of their target customers. Understanding buying behavior can also help 
companies better understand their competition and develop strategies to gain a competitive 
advantage.

This research provides valuable insights for marketing professionals who are looking for ways 
to better understand customer behavior and preferences. The findings of this research can 
be used to help companies identify customer segments, target them more effectively, and 
increase customer loyalty and marketing performance.
